      <h2>Why I Want to Become a Lawyer</h2>
      <p>I’m driven by the idea of advocating for those who can’t speak for themselves. I want to help people navigate hard situations and protect what matters most — their rights, their families, and their future.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Family</h2>
      <p>Family means everything to me. I hope to be a present and loving father one day, someone who leads with patience, provides with purpose, and builds a home filled with trust, faith, and support. The values I carry now are shaped by the kind of family I want to create in the future.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Starting a Business Someday</h2>
      <p>I’d love to someday start a business that supports wellness, community, or families — maybe even tie in my legal knowledge to help others. I’m excited to see where life leads me.</p>
